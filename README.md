# InSoLiTo database

Before starting to install the datase and its webpage, `docker` and `docker compose v2` is needed for the installation.

### Download the data

* If you want to use the data available from InSoLiTo, download the following data from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6359386):

```
cd DB
wget https://zenodo.org/api/files/e8f78917-1d81-4fbd-a183-6605f33d14e3/InSoLiToImport.tar.gz 
tar -xzf InSoLiToImport.tar.gz
cd ..
```
* If you use your own data, create a folder called `InSoLiToImport` inside `DB` and insert your CSV files there.

### Use Docker to compile the database with the webpage

* Before starting, we create the folders where the webpage will be outputted:

```
mkdir REST/
mkdir REST/static
```

* Then, in the root directory use the following command line:

```
docker compose up -d
```

The docker containers will be running in detached mode. You can check the logs with `docker compose logs`.

The Neo4j database, that is empty at the moment, is available in http://localhost:7474/browser/.

### Populate the database

* Before populate the database, please follow the instructions in [DB/Install.md](DB/Install.md).

* Then, we need to create the nodes and relationships into the Neo4j database. The data is taken from the CSV files located in the `InSoLiToImport` folder.

```
cd DB/
source .pyDBenv/bin/activate
python Neo4jScripts/CreateNeo4jDataset.py
```

You can check the full graph database in http://localhost:7474/browser/.

* Also, two files for running the autocomplete and the slider part of the webpage will be created.

```
python retrieve_json.py
deactivate
cd ..
```

### Compile the Webpage

Assure that the newest version of npm is installed:

```
cd FRONTEND
npm install --no-save npm
```

* Add `node_modules/.bin` subdirectory to the `PATH` environment variable, so newest `npm`, `yarn` and other installation dependencies can be instantiated:

```
PATH="$(npm bin):${PATH}"
export PATH
```

* Next line installs [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installation dependency, which is used to fetch [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and other dependencies:

```
npm install --no-save yarn
```

* Then, call `yarn`, so the other dependencies are fetched:

```bash
yarn --frozen-lockfile
```

* Now, you have to run `webpack` in order to prepare and deploy the InSoLiTo site, which will be deployed at `../REST/static` subdirectory.

```bash
webpack --progress --color
```

Congratulations! The webpage will be available in http://localhost:0080/index-test.html
